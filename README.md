# trainScheduler

In this assignment, I'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. 

This app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. 

This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
